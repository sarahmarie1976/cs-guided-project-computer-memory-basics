" If each slot in memory holds 8 bits and we want to store an array of 64-bit integers, how many memory addresses will be required to store an arry of 5 integers"

A-  40

B-  30

C-  32

D-  48

Answer is: 

    C - 40

    take the 64 bit integer 
    multiply it by the array of integers (5)

    Then divide it by the bits with the 8 bits

    64 * 5 = 320 / 8 = 40
